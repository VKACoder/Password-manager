# Password-manager
In a world full of data insecurity, storing and accessing passwords are becoming a cumbersome process. Here I've developed a simple, easy to use password manager using python and MySQL, which one can use to store their username and password in an encrypted way. This is just a project to put my python and MySQL connectivity skills into a practical approach.
