# Password-manager
In a world full of data insecurity, storing and accessing passwords are becoming a cumbersome process. Here I've developed a simple, easy to use password manager using python and MySQL, which one can use to store their username and password in an encrypted way. But please don't take this project too seriously and store your valueable credentials! I'm not responsible for your loss of data. This is just a project to put my python and MySQL connectivity skills into a practical approach.
